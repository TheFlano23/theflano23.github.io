			<p> Software is what controls and directs the operations of all hardware, which includes all applicable storage devices. Software basically causes hardware to perform processes that help the system achieve its intended purpose.  There are two main types of software found in modern computers, that being application software, and the operating system (OS).
			<h2 class="bottomrule">Operating Systems</h2>
			<p>The operating system is the first piece of software that a user will see when they boot up a computer, and the last one they see when they turn it off. It's main purpose is to control and organise hardware and other pieces of software onboard. They provide a way for applications to use the hardware without knowing the precise manner of it. They are also used to control the resources of the system.</p>
			<p> OSs come with many utilities to aid in the operation of some system functions. Some of these are:
			<ul> <!--Unordered list-->

				<li>Defragmenting hard drives</li>
				<li>Creating storage or OS backups</li>

			</ul>

			<h2 class="bottomrule">Application Software</h2>
			<p> Application software, or more widely known as just applications or 'apps', is a piece of software that performs a specific, specialised task. The software is being applied to the solution of a certain problem. With applications the user is able to do more things with their computer, such as using the Internet, playing video games, typing documents, and even creating websites like this. There are also types of applications for non commercial purposes, used by companies, banks, and governments, for example.</p>
