			<p> Hardware is another crucial part of a computer. They are physical components which you can interact with, unlike software, where everything is digital. There are five functions performed by hardware devices: input, output, processing, storage and control, but I'll only focus on input, output and storage on this page.</p>
			
			<h2 class="bottomrule">Input Hardware</h2>
			<p>Input is a hardware function which sends data into the computer from exterior devices. These devices can also be built into the system, like webcams or laptop keyboards. Usually a user has to interact with input hardware in order for it to send data to the system. There are many types of input devices that users interact with frequently, the most common type being peripherals such as mice and keyboards. There are also other types of input devices used like microphones, scanners, and graphic tablets.</p>

			<h2 class="bottomrule">Output Hardware</h2>
			<p>Output hardware functions similarly to input hardware, the main difference being it is the component that sends data <em>from</em> the computer. Examples include monitors, printers, Wi-Fi or Ethernet, or speakers. </p>

			</figure>
			
			<h2 class="bottomrule">Storage Hardware</h2>
			<p>I talked about storage in the <a href="cpu_storage.html">CPU and Storage</a> page, so the description here will more or less be the same, just more condensed. There are two types of storage, namely primary and secondary storage. Primary storage is known for its speed, which is required to keep up with the processor, and its volatility, which means that data is lost when the power is cut off. Secondary storage is used for long term storage, like saved files and applications. They are non volatile, meaning that data is retained when power is lost. Examples of this include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Hard drives</li>
				<li>Solid state drives</li>
				<li>Flash memory</li>
				<li>Floppy disks</li>
				<li>Magnetic tape</li>
				<li>Punch cards</li>
				<li>Optical storage, like CDs and DVDs</li>
			</ul>
